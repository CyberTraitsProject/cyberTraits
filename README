The process to run the code:
============================

1.  run the method - create_csv_for_machine_learning.
    this method found in the file main_process.py.
    this method do:
    1.1 run method questionnaires_main, that found in the file questionnaires.py, and that create the pickle file that contains the questionnaires data.
    1.2 run on every candidate that has app data + questionnaires data, and calculate him the all what we defined.
    1.3 create a file machine_learning_data.csv that contains the data for the machine learning, without the traits.
    1.4 save the list of the candidates in a pickle file.

2.  run the method - organize_data_to_machine_learning_main.
    this method found in the file organize_data_to_machine_learning_main.py.
    this method do:
    2.1 scaling the data.
    2.2 do feature selection.
    2.3 create for every trait, a csv file for machine learning.

3.  run the method - machine_learning_model_main.
    this method found in the file machine_learning_model.py.
    this method do:
    3.1 run on every file of the machine learning (of every trait).
    3.2 have number of machine learning methods.
    3.3 split the data to train(75%) and test(25%).
    3.4 run the train data on a model.
    3.5 check the results of the test data.
